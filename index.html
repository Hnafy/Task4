            <td><div>As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the <br>study of celestial bodies by applying the laws of <br>physics and chemistry. The field applies laws of <br>different subjects like thermodynamics, molecular <br>physics, relativity, particle physics, etc. This book <br>unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics, <br>which will be crucial for the holistic understanding <br>of the subject matter.</div></td>
